This repository contains the Bubble Sort implementation in Python. In short, Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that compares each two adjacent elements as long as the current element is larger than the next element.

Bubble Sort's Time and Space Complexity:

    Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ] : O(n2)
    Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega] : O(n)
    Space Complexity : O(1)
